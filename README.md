# Silent Hill 2 Result Changer

I was researching Silent Hill save file for the save editor program and found the game result values and i decided to make a game result changer for green spray. 
Program only works when you load endgame save (actually at 1.0 Version it was running while you're in game but it has some bugs after fixing that bugs it will be possible again).

I'm also working on save editor and RNG viewer after its ready i will release.

# HOW TO USE

1-) First open the game and load you're end game save

2-) Open the result changer program and press "Start Result Hack" button.

4-) You can now edit you're things.

5-) If you want to save you're changes press "Save Changes" button.
