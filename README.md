# Silent Hill Result Changer

I was researching Silent Hill save file for the save editor program and found the game result values and i decided to make a game result changer for green spray. 
Program only works when you're in game. Be careful after editting don't save you're game at save points or quick save because its affects game too. If you don't want to harm you're save file...

Or you can wait my upcoming save editor also i'm working on RNG viewer.

# HOW TO USE

1-) First open the game and start new game.
2-) Open the result changer program and press "Start Result Hack" button.
3-) After that game will load "Game Result" window
4-) You can edit you're things.
5-) If you want to save you're changes made press "Save Changes" button. If you don't you can click "Exit Without Save" button.
